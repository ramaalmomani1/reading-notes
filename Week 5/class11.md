# Event Driven Applications

----

**1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?**

> events

**2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?**

> Object-oriented programming enhances event-driven programming, by combining OOP and EDP, we can build scalable and modular applications that effectively respond to events while promoting code reuse and maintainability.

**3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.**

> On social media platform let's say user creates a new post. With event-driven programming, the backend can immediately process this event and perform actions such as storing the post in the database, updating the user's profile, and notifying user's followers about the new post. By using event-driven programming with Node.js in the backend of the social media platform, you can efficiently handle user interactions, process events in real-time, update data, and trigger appropriate actions.
