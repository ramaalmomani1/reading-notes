1. How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)

> 1. useReducer and useContext are powerful React hooks that work together to simplify state management. useReducer handles state transitions, while useContext provides global state access. When combined, they reduce prop passing and improve code organization.
> 2. The combination of useReducer and useContext is especially useful in larger React apps, making state management more efficient. This approach centralizes state logic, making it accessible to components without prop drilling, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code.
