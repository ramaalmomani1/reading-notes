# Data Structures and Algorithms
---

#### why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module?

> Since it is considered to be one of the basic concepts to be learned, learning it also improves problem-solving skills.


#### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

> It depends on the problem itself, each data structure is more suitable and efficient than others to solve a particular problem.

#### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

> By defining a base case.
