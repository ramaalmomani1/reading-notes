**There are 4 ideas provided in the videos and article to be discussed;**

**1- Deliberate practice**

>No one is born with the ability to do something, what happens is we become interested in something early on and begin doing it every day, we begin we fail and then we try again until we get it right, and then we explore everything related and practice that. The idea of deliberate practice is trying over and over, trying different things in different ways, setting our goals and knowing where our gaps are and working on it then getting our results and moving on to the next problem, and that’s how we deliberately practice.

**2- Growth mindset**

>The idea of the growth mindset is not limiting someones ability to how well they perform but giving them a chance to learn from their mistakes and try again, teaching them that failure isn’t the end, that they have not yet failed.
This connects to the idea of deliberate practice in that you need to keep trying and practicing in order to learn and grow.

**3- Grit**

>What keeps someone going and what prevents them from giving up is how passionate they are about the subject and how much they care about it, this relating to the previous ideas can be achieved by adopting the growth mindset, because when we feel like we failed at something we grow to resent it and we lose the passion we once had, however when we teach ourselves that we never really fail we just have not yet succeeded, it gives us a new perspective and encourages us to keep trying and practicing until we get it right.

**4- Success** 
>Our definition of success is what pushes us to achieve what we want, if we hang onto the idea that success is being like someone else, we begin to limit ourselves and constantly be bitter and hateful of the person we’re comparing ourselves with, comparing is detrimental to our mental health and our ability to grow, each person has their own journey and setbacks and so our idea of success must be related to how well we overcome our difficulties and how much we learn and grow.
This of course relates to the growth mindset, practice and grit, moreover if we have the growth mindset our definition of success will be achieving the goals we are passionate about and the ones which we practiced and grew to achieve.

>**In summary** if we continue on our deliberate practice and adopt the growth mindset of believing you never truly fail if you keep trying as well as holding on to our passions and the reasons we enjoy what we do despite its constant challenges we can achieve our own definition of success that is more kind and gentle.

I have 17 and 18 respectively in Social Awareness and Relationship Management, I think I need to improve them.

**6. BIAS**

> I got a score of 85 out of 120, which means that I am at a good level and have room for development and improvement, especially in the areas where weaknesses were found, such as CULTIVATE CONNECTION: CONNECT TO MITIGATE BIAS and BIAS AND IDENTITY. My strongest areas are BIAS AND THE BRAIN and EMPATHY AND CURIOSITY. I still want to develop them. But I want to concentrate on my areas of weakness in the upcoming weeks and beyond.
